## üìñ About

**ContainerCleaner** is a port of my CERN project, *PodmanCleaner*. It runs automatically via **cron** or **systemd**, and can:

- Optionally pull a git repository
- Pull the latest container images
- Recreate Docker Compose or Docker Swarm containers
- Remove unused images

This helps:

- Keep storage use to a minimum on the host
- Ensure all services are up-to-date
- Prevent hung processes or stale containers

Currently supports **Docker Compose** and **Docker Swarm** only. Future support for Podman, Kubernetes, or standalone Docker may be added based on demand.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install

> üêß These instructions assume a **Debian-based distro** (e.g., Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS). 

### 1. Install required system packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git curl python3 python3-pip
```

### 2. Install required Python modules:

Via **APT**:
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-colorama python3-git python3-docker python3-requests python3-yaml
```

Or via **pip**:
```bash
pip install colorama gitpython docker requests pyyaml
```

### 3. Clone and enter the repository:

```bash
cd /usr/share/ && sudo git clone https://github.com/jamess60/containercleaner.git && cd containercleaner
```

### 4. Configure containercleaner (Refer to section below for more help):

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/containercleaner/conf/config.ini
```

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/containercleaner/src/functions/ntfy.py
```

### 5. Manually test the script:

```bash
python3 /usr/share/containercleaner/src/ContainerCleaner.py
```

### 6. Enable the systemd timer:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/containercleaner/conf/systemd/* /etc/systemd/system/ && sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable containercleaner.timer
```

### üìù Additional Install Notes:

- If you prefer **cron**, an example is provided in `conf/ContainerCleaner.cron`.
- To change the timer frequency, edit `conf/systemd/containercleaner.timer` before copying it.
- **Running both `docker_compose` and `docker_swarm` modes in the same instance is not supported**. Use separate instances if needed.
- If you are running containercleaner in a none defualt location (anywhere other than /usr/share/containercleaner), you will need to modify line 10 in src/functions/ntfy.py and line 29 in ContainerCleaner.py to reflect the new location of the config file.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**1. The script says "This script may KILL and DELETE containers without confirmation" ‚Äì is that true?**  
üëâ It only kills/recreates containers the same way `docker compose up -d` or `docker stack deploy` would. No containers are stopped unless they need to be updated. This is the only way to rebase a container on to a new image, and alternative tools (such as Watchtower) would do the same. 

**2. Why not just use a one-liner bash script?**  
üëâ That would limit future features like `ntfy` integration, config parsing, and Swarm support.

**3. Isn't this basically Watchtower with extra steps?**  
üëâ Sort of ‚Äî but Watchtower can be slow to recreate containers and doesn‚Äôt always clean up old images.  
ContainerCleaner is a faster, more secure alternative that avoids using `docker.sock` directly.

**4. I use Docker Swarm ‚Äî where should I run this?**  
üëâ Run it on **one manager node** only. Worker nodes can‚Äôt deploy stacks.  
If you want redundancy, install it on **two manager nodes**, spacing their timers at least an hour apart.

## üåü Feature Wishlist
- [ ] Dry run/simulation mode
- [ ] Full logging support
- [ ] Multi-repo & multi-file support
- [ ] Packaging as `.deb`, `.rpm`
